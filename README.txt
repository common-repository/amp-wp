== Installation ==

=== Minimum Requirements ===
* Install [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) and regenerate your post thumbnails to avoid breaking the layout on post list.
* PHP version 7.4 or greater
* MySQL version 8 or greater OR MariaDB version 10.5 or greater

=== Automatic Installation ===
Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't even need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install, log in to your WordPress admin panel, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type "AMP WP" and click Search Plugins. Once you've found the plugin you can view details about it such as the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by clicking _Install Now_.

=== Manual Installation ===

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

* Download the plugin file to your computer and unzip it.
* Using an FTP program, or your hosting control panel,  upload the unzipped plugin folder to your WordPress installation's `wp-content/plugins/` directory to your web server.
* Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' from menu in WordPress admin panel.
* Use the AMP WP -> Customize AMP screen to configure the plugin

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the URL for AMP pages? =

There are 2 URL structures for an AMP site:
1) /amp/ at the start of the URLs i.e. https://yoursite.com/amp/page-name
2) /amp/ at the end of the URLs i.e. https://yoursite.com/page-name/amp

We support both structures.

= Can I add analytics? =

Yes, you can add third party analytics by going to AMP WP > Settings > Analytics option from the WP Admin Dashboard Menu.

= Layout broken on Post Listing? =

If you're experiencing any broken layouts on post listing, it's most probably due to difference in the thumbnail sizes. Please regenerate your thumbnails by using this plugin: [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).

= Do you have any prebuilt layouts? =

Yes, we have 2 layouts for listing. You can set them from AMP WP Option Panel.

= How do I add Custom HTML Tags Support? =

You can add custom HTML code snippets. The snippets can be added between <head></head> tags or right after <body> tag or right before </body> tag. All 3 options can be accessed by going to the Customizer Settings Panel (Dashboard > AMP WP > Customize AMP).

Please Note: Only valid and compatible AMP snippets would work.
